Vitamin D 40000 mg per day. The good about vitamin D is you could not take it daily you could take 
it every 4 days for example.
### Lose Skin
HIIT exercise to creat motion in loose skin area to drive grows hormone to go there.
Periodic prolonged fasting (Do the autopahgy). Dry brush in skin for example in shower.
Get high quality vitamin E and rub that.

## Hair
### Thicker Hair
1. Low Iron: Like red meat a few times a week. Eggs, Cheese. Iron is for creating Hemoglobin and Hemoglobin carries Oxygen and if you don't have Hemoglobin in 
   the scalp you don't have Oxygen for the roots of hair
2. Low Zinc: Best for hair, skin, nails. Zinc works with hundreds of Enzymes especially with making
   proteins. And hair is protein. Over exercise, Accident and other stressful situation or get a lot of  
   copper can cause the cortisol to spike and causes you to increase the requirement of Zinc.  
   Shellfish, Oysters, red meat
3. Low Omega3: Very anti-inflammatory on fish, Cod liver oil. Omega6 increase causes decrease Omega3.
   Alopecia is for too much inflammation
4. Low vitamin D: Vitamin D estimates hair growth and very important to immune aspects of hair
5. Low Selenium: Very important on Thyroid health (especially for slow thyroid) and reduce inflammation
   counter Alopecia and also Dandruff(shore sar). One Brazilian nut is okay.
6. Low Biotin: Enhance Keratin (Hair protein type). Our own microbiome makes Biotin. Don't eat antibiotics
   because it leads to kill micro-biomes 
7. Low Folate: Not recommend taking Folic Acid because it is synthetic. Start consuming salad. It is in
   dark leafy greens
8. Low vitamin C: Essential for collagen strength (Hernia collagen strength). Plenty of vitamin C from 
   sauerkraut, Cabbage, Berries, Bell peppers, and all vegetables. Having much vitamin C makes collagen 
   very strong (posteton chrok nemishe)
9. Low protein: In ketogenic diet. Consume more egg
10. Over-washing hair: and don't clean with sulfate shampoo
11. What: Sea kelp, use sulfate fee shampoo, use conditioner, anti fluoride and chlorine filter of water.

  can take over

----------------------------------------
## Fasting

* ### Regular Fasting
    * #### What to drink
        1. Apple Cider Vinegar
        2. 1. Water, tea, herb tea, green tea (perfect)

* ### Prolonged Fasting
    * #### Benefits 
        1. Most important thing you could do for your health

           digestive inflammatory disease
        8. Way powerful than regular Intermittent fasting and takes you health result to the next level
        9. During fast, your body becomes very very sensitive to Insulin 
    * #### Mistakes:
        1. Because in the fast your body is Insulin sensitive don't eat Carbohydrates (even fruits and Berries)
           the reason is that: you create Stem cells and ready to turn into something that repairs your body
           or repair your Immune system, if there is to many Carbs especially when you break the fast guess what
           they turn into Fat cells (The last cells you want in your body). For example my voice becomes 
           deeper and after fast it becomes normal. Do stem veggies, fermented vegetables, bone broth,
           kefir, eggs and **Keep it really really small**.
           If you eat Carbs after prolonged fasting, the amount of Potassium (Severe hypokalemic) in 
           blood gets low and in cell gets high. That's increase your pulse rate and get sick(Dangerous). 
           Refeeding fast throws off your electrolytes.
        2. Doing intense exercise or a lot of physical work right after prolonged fasting. Because your
              your body has just been though a lot of autophagy repair, recycling, rejuvenation and don't 
              add that stress at that point. But do it in Intermittent Fasting. And take supplement.
        3. Overeating: Don't overeat because digestive system gone sleep. Wake it up slowly. So, eat 
           small amount and several hours small amount again.
        4. Drink Apple Cider Vinegar: Because in Prolonged Fasting you body is acidic. Take some 
           Baking Sodo 1/4 teaspoon (Alkaline) mix it with water and drink it after fasting. 
        5. Eating protein powders: Insulin index is very high
    * ### Notes:
        1. Drink 1/4 teaspoon of Baking Soda after fasting Neutralized Keto acidity and give you Sodium
      
    * ### How to fast:
        1. Every body needs to get prolonged fast.
        2. Recommend 3 days or more
        3. Gradually adopt fast and let your body say how much fast. 48 then 3 days then 4 days and
           then 7 days (Magical happens in 7 days)
        4. If you have Cancer you do it as often as you can
        5. For example 4 day fast to handle major problem once a month
        
  * ### What to drink:
      1. No Apple Cider Vinegar
      2. Water, tea, herb tea, green tea (perfect)
      3. Coffee fine
      4. Baking Soda

* ### Intermittent Fasting (IF)
    * #### What could eat
        1. Water, tea, herb tea, green tea (perfect)
        2. Apple cider Vinegar 
        3. Coffee fine

----------------------------------------
## Bodybuilding 

----------------------------------------
## Mood
When your mood is not okay look at the followings 
* ### Nutrients 
  * #### Potassium 
    1. Important mineral for relaxing body
    2. Decrease heart rate and calm the heart down
    3. 4700 mg needed a day (7-10 cups of vegetables/salad per day or Kale shake in the morning)
    4. Treat not sleeping because of the heart rate pumping at night (Boom! boom!) 
    (Check after prolonged fasting if you eat too much your potassium goes to cells, and you get potassium deficiency)
    5. Really important for stabilizing blood sugar 
  * #### B Vitamins specially B1
    1. Anxious, restlessness(like restless leg), see nightmare if is depleted 
    2. Can be depleted by stress (You need more when you are under stress or pushing your body)
    3. Can be depleted by too much coffee, tea and red wine
    4. Prevent nightmare
    5. Best source is nutritional yeast (1 teaspoon with yogurt or Kale shake)
    6. Other source is Beef, Eggs, Kale, Pork, Salmon, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds
  * #### Calcium 
    1. Helps you relax, calm down (When you under stress) 
    2. Can be depleted by stress (and couldn't absorb it)
    3. Best source 
    4. Not recommended calcium carbonate because is like cement, and it is rock based and don't absorb
    5. Recommended calcium citrate from cheese, plain yogurt
  * #### Omega3 
    1. Very very very important in cognitive function especially for children 
    2. It is usually rancid so get a higher quality fish oil rather than cheap ones. Open up capsule and
    smell it and if it is not fishy it is probably good
  * #### Iodine 
    1. Sea kelp is the best source of iodine 
    2. Iodine supports the thyroid and thyroid helps the cognitive function
    3. Children/Adult that mentally retarded usually have an iodine deficiency because the mother was deficient
       and, it transported over the baby.
    4. Make sure have enough iodine when your child is growing, you are nursing, you are going to have a 
    baby or pregnant

    
* ### Blood sugars 100 is normal
      Kale shake (Potassium rich from eric berg website) in the morning is wonderful to establish the blood sugar through the whole day
  Eat 7-10 cups of salads to get proper amount of potassium. Goes from carb based breakfast to protein based ones.
  Fats needed for regulating blood sugar between meals

    2. ADD
    3. Be edgy
  * #### High blood sugar
    1. Have brain fog
    2. Loss of memory

    
* ### Hormones 
  * #### Serotonin the pleasure hormone
    Taking the psych drug they recycle the last drop of serotonin over and over again tricking body 
    and thinking that it has more than it really does. So, you ended up causing a deficiency over the time
    even more and the need for that medication rises over time. And you need more to ruins the body.
    So, Start to building up serotonin with good diet
  * #### Cortisol the stress hormone
    1. Comes from all types of stress like push yourself over the years, work two jobs, 
       don't sleep, don't take care of yourself, party too much
    2. The symptoms are anxiety, worry, thinking all the time
    3. Walking each day

    5. Sleeping 
    6. Keeping the diet good
    7. Avoiding stressful people
  * #### PMS
    Is there relationship between your cycle and your mood? If so then you need to support the ovary
    (Some women get very irritable in that time of month or even certain times of the month) and avoid dairy
  * #### Thyroid
    See the thyroid section.
  

* ### Sleep
**The more stress you under, the longer you need to sleep**. Sleep is a natural repair for body stress.
Without sleep, you gonna more anxiety, worry, stress mode. So, don't get 7 hours get 8.
